*Use window events (window listener/window adapter) to display dialog when user tries to close window without having
 saved data. Remember to change defaultCloseOperation to DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE.

*Use boolean variable to detect whether data has been changed or not.

*Add JMenuBar to JFrame instead of JPanel. Use setJMenuBar.
